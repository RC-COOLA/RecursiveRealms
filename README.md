# RecursiveRealms
## Objective Task:
This console-based recursive creativity game uses recursion to simulate an exploration of a a dungeon. Each room is represented by a recursive function, and the player can decide whether to continue exploring or exit the dungeon. The depth of the recursions are shown with thier depths.

## How Does It Work:
1. The player starts at the entrance of the dungeon.
2. The rooms are shown with a description of each room and can choose to go deeper or exit out of the dunegon.
3. The function recursively calls its own self to go deeper into the dungeon.
4. The game ends once the player chooses to exit the game.

## Recursion Strategy:
This program uses recursion to display the dungeon's rooms. The depth of recursion increases within each room the player decides to enters. Each level, the player will be shown a new decision. Once the player decides to exit, the recursion call stops and the game ends.
